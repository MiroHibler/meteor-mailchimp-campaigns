# meteor-mailchimp-campaigns

MailChimp Campaigns - the Meteor way.


## Dependencies

 * [meteor-mailchimp](https://github.com/MiroHibler/meteor-mailchimp) - A Meteor wrapper for the MailChimp API


## TL;DR;

_meteor-mailchimp-campaigns_ helps you to manage mailing campaigns.

Further information on the MailChimp API and its features is available at [https://github.com/gomfunkel/node-mailchimp](https://github.com/gomfunkel/node-mailchimp).


## Templates

_meteor-mailchimp-campaigns_ also exposes one template you can use out of the box: `MailChimpCampaigns`, which will render all mailing campaigns for a given mailing list.


## Installation

Install using [Meteorite](https://github.com/oortcloud/meteorite) - Installer & smart package manager for Meteor:

```sh
$ mrt add mailchimp-campaigns // It will install meteor-mailchimp package if it's not already installed
```

Use in your template (**will use Session variable 'MailChimpOptions.listId' for default list**):

```html
<div id="mailChimpCampaigns">
	{{> MailChimpCampaigns}}
</div>
```

Put in your server's Meteor.startup():

```javascript
MailChimpOptions.apiKey = '<Your MailChimp API Key>';
MailChimpOptions.listId = '<ID of your default mailing list>';
```

or in your client's Meteor.startup():

```javascript
Session.setDefault( 'MailChimpOptions.apiKey', '<Your MailChimp API Key>' );
Session.setDefault( 'MailChimpOptions.listId', '<ID of your default mailing list>' );
```

This way you don't have to pass these parameters on each call.

## Example

```javascript
if ( Meteor.isServer ) {
	// Set it once and reuse many times
	MailChimpOptions.apiKey = "<Your MailChimp API Key>";
	MailChimpOptions.listId = "<ID of your default mailing list>";
}

try {
	// You can as well pass different parameters on each call
	var mailingCampaigns = new MailChimpCampaigns( /* apiKey, { version : '2.0' } */ );
} catch ( error ) {
	console.log( error.message );
}

mailingCampaigns.list(
	{ /*
		filters: { list_id: '<some_list_id>' },
		start: 0,
		limit: 100,
		sort_field: '',
		sort_dir: '' */
	},
	function ( error, result ) {
		if ( error ) {
			console.log( error.message );
		} else {
			console.log( JSON.stringify( result ) );
		}
	}
);
```
