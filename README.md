Further information on the MailChimp API and its features is available at
[https://github.com/gomfunkel/node-mailchimp](https://github.com/gomfunkel/node-mailchimp).


## Templates

Use in your template (**will use Session variable 'MailChimp.lists.listId' for default list**):

_miro:mailchimp-campaigns_ also exposes one template you can use out of the box:
`{{> MailChimpCampaigns}}`, which will render all mailing campaign for a given
mailing list.


## Installation

Install using Meteor:

```sh
meteor add miro:mailchimp-campaigns // It will add miro:mailchimp package
									// if not not already installed
```

## Quick Start

Use in your template:

```html
<div id="mailChimpCampaings">
	<!-- There's also another utility template
	     you can use to refresh the list -->
	{{> MailChimpCampaingsRefresh}}
	{{> MailChimpCampaings}}
</div>
```

Put in your server's settings.json:

```javascript
{
	"private": {
		"MailChimp": {
			"apiKey": "<Your MailChimp API Key>",
			"listId": "<ID of your default mailing list>"
		}
	}
}
```

and start your server with:

```sh
meteor --settings settings.json
```

 * **REACTIVE** - will re-render the template if session variable `MailChimp.lists.listId` changes

## Examples

### Callback, server-side/client-side

```javascript
// You can as well pass different parameters on each call
var mailingCampaigns = new MailChimpCampaigns( /* apiKey, { version : '2.0' } */ );

mailingCampaigns.campaigns(
	{ /*
		filters: {
			list_id: '<some_mailing_list_id>'
		},
		start: 0,
		limit: 100,
		sort_field: '',
		sort_dir: '' */
	},
	// Callback beauty in action
	function ( error, result ) {
		if ( error ) {
			console.error( '[MailChimpCampaigns][Campaigns] Error: %o', error );
		} else {
			// Do something with your data!
			console.info( '[MailChimpCampaigns][Campaigns]: %o', result );
		}
	}
);
```

### wrapAsync, server-side ONLY

```javascript
// You can as well pass different parameters on each call
var mailingCampaigns = new MailChimpCampaigns( /* apiKey, { version : '2.0' } */ );

var result = mailingCampaigns.campaigns(
	{ /*
		filters: {
			list_id: '<some_mailing_list_id>'
		},
		start: 0,
		limit: 100,
		sort_field: '',
		sort_dir: '' */
	}
);

```
